# HFT SS24 - Operating Systems - Exercises


## Setup
### GitHub Codespace
With GitHub Codespaces you use a machine in the cloud. This allows you to carry out the exercises without having Linux and other tools installed and enabled to scale upt to 32 cores for the multi-threading exercises. [https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository?tool=webui](How to create a codespace)


I recommend to fork this repository into your own account to be able to commit changes. [https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo](How to fork a repo)


### Local
Alternatively, the exercises can be carried out locally, but I will not offer any assistance if there are problems with the package installation.
However if you using ubuntu you probably need the following additional packages:
* `strace`
* `build-essential`
* `gcc`
* `pkg-config`
* `libfuse3-dev`
* `fdisk`
